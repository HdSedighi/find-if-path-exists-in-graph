# Intuition
My first thought to solve the problem is to represent the graph using an adjacency list and then use a graph traversal algorithm such as breadth-first search (BFS) to explore the graph starting from the source vertex. By using BFS, we can explore the graph level by level and determine whether there is a valid path from the source vertex to the destination vertex. If we reach the destination vertex during the traversal, it means there is a valid path; otherwise, there is no valid path.

# Approach
1. Graph Representation: Represent the given graph using an adjacency list. Initialize a list of lists (or a dictionary) to store the neighbors for each vertex.
2. BFS Initialization: Initialize a queue for the BFS algorithm and a set to keep track of visited vertices. Add the source vertex to the queue and mark it as visited.
3. BFS Execution: While the queue is not empty, dequeue a vertex and check its neighbors. If we encounter the destination vertex during the search, return true.
4. Visit Neighbors: For each neighbor of the current vertex, if it hasn't been visited yet, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.
5. Return Result: If the search exhausts without reaching the destination vertex, return false.
# Complexity
- Time complexity:
The time complexity of the BFS algorithm is O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. This is because each vertex and edge is processed exactly once during the traversal.
- Space complexity:
The space complexity is also O(V+E), which includes the adjacency list representation of the graph and the data structures (queue and set) used during the BFS traversal.
